Welcome to my 2nd Mod! If you like this mod you're sure to like my other Mod "NPC Control"!

At the moment this mod has only 1 Feature:
- Ban Items of your choosing (They're getting deleted and a Chat Message pops up)

Hope this will help some Server Owners with their "Item Frame" problems and such.

Also compatible with Items from other mods!

How to use:
1. Ingame go to settings
2. Click Mod Configuration
3. Click "Item Control: ItemConfig"
4. Add Items of your choosing to the list
5. Click Save after you put the banned items on the list.

Note: This mod intentionally only works in multiplayer for now

Planned features
- Excempts for getting checked
